# Image-Super-Resolution
This project aims to implement and compare super-resolution using both convolutional neural networks as well as a transformer model. The project team plans to train a convolutional neural network from scratch for the purposes of 4x super-resolution, and to fine tune an existing transformer model. The expectation is that the convolutional neural network will outperform classic algorithmic approaches, while the transformer model will outperform the convolutional network. The primary data set for training in this project was chosen due to its relatively low usage for this problem.
